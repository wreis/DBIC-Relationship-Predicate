# DESCRIPTION

[DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) component to automatically create predicates for relationship accessors in a result class.
By default, it creates `"has_${rel_accessor_name}"` methods and injects into the class,
thus for that case we would have 'has\_baz', 'has\_buzz' and 'has\_bars' methods on `$foo` row object. You can
define the name for each one (or also disable its creation using `undef` as value) by setting 'predicate'
key in the relationship's attrs hashref.

    __PACKAGEE_->might_have(
        'buzz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Buzz', 'foo_id',
        { 'predicate' => 'got_a_buzz' }
    );

    or

    __PACKAGEE_->might_have(
        'buzz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Buzz', 'foo_id',
        { 'predicate' => undef }
    );
